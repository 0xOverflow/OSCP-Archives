# OSCP-Archives

During my journey to getting the OSCP, I always come across many articles, Git repo, and other types of sources of great and valuable information that helps me during my studies. While having all of these in a bookmark folder is great, I wanted to also build a curated list of the resources that I've collected overtime, all in one area for everyone to access. I am by no means the only one with this list, but having another source won't hurt :)

This list will continue to grow over time as I come across new resources.

PS. A VERY big thank you to all the authors of these resources, for taking the time and energy putting this invaluable information together.

## Enjoy!
